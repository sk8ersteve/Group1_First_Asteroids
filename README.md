# Group1_First_Asteroids

Game created for CMU's NHSGA.

This is a remake of the classic game Asteroids which has been been restylized. In this version, you play as a 
skiing wizard trying to destroy all surrounding evil magical snowmen, and the evil snowboarding wizard who shoots back.

Game was created in one week for the "Lightning Round" of the summer experience.
